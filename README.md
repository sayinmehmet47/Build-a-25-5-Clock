- The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student
- The original technique has six steps:

Decide on the task to be done.
Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is an interval of work time.
